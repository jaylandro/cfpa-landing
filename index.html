            Cfpa is expanding its <em>mission</em>, <em>space</em>, and
            <em>programming</em>
          </h2>
          <p>
            Cfpa is building a new 20,000 square foot expansion on the existing
            site. It will house more private office space, rehearsal/class
            space, and two new 100 seat performance spaces. This project is
            innovating a sustainable ecosystem for artists and arts businesses
            in its design.

      <p>
        In 2020, Cfpa will celebrate 25 years as an arts and community resource.
        Thousands of students, artists and small businesses have thrived at Cfpa
        in artist’s residencies, piano lessons, dance rehearsals, or summer
        camps.
      </p>
      <p>
        This expansion will impact all artists in the Twin Cities by offering a
        new south Minneapolis location to practice, perform and produce work.
      </p>

      <h2 id="project">Support Economic Innovation.</h2>
      <p>
        Eight long-standing performance organizations and venues in the Twin
        Cities have recently closed, reduced, or suspended operations. They
        hosted the work of a wide range of artists, performance traditions,
        races, gender identities, and cultures – all left in the wake.
        Innovating alternate economic models for artists and arts organization
        is a critical need.
      </p>

      <h2 id="goals">Give a gift.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Provide affordable, high-quality facilities and equipment for artists
          and audiences.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sponsor artist residencies, mentorships, workshops, educational

        </li>
        <li>
          Catalyze the integration of artists' work into the everyday lives of
          our neighborhood and the metro.
        </li>

          Support the essential research, development and implementation of
          models for artistic sustainability.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>You are our community.</h2>

      <p>
        Artists are our social and cultural leaders. We invite you to join us in
        giving to this project. Investment in this project with your gift is a
